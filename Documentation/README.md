# Koor Storage Distribution

Koor Storage Distribution is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator**, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Koor Storage Distribution turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Koor Storage Distribution uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Koor Storage Distribution integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.
